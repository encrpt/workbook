When resolving conflicts on a merge or rebase, this script
automates `git add/rm` and `git checkout` with --ours or --theirs
for a large batch of changes.

Usage: `python3 git_batch_resolver.py` in your git repository.

Note:
  in `git merge`, ours -> current branch, theirs -> other branch
  in `git rebase`, ours -> other branch, theirs -> current branch
